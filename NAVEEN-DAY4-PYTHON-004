Given two integers, M and N, calculate the sum of the cubes of all integers from M to N inclusive. If M is greater than N, the result should be zero or an appropriate message should be displayed.

Input Format

Input:

M = 2 N = 4

Constraints

NO Constraints

Output Format

Output:

63

Explanation: The sum of the cubes of 2, 3, and 4 is 8 + 27 + 64 = 99.

M should be less than or equal to N







# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
# Input
M = int(input())
N = int(input())

# Check validity
if M > N:
    print("M should be less than or equal to N")
else:
    sum_cubes = 0
    for i in range(M, N + 1):
        sum_cubes += i ** 3
    print(sum_cubes)
