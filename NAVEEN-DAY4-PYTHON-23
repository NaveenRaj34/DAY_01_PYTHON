The program to find if the given numbers are Friendly pairs or not (Amicable or not) is discussed here. Friendly Pairs are two or more numbers with a common abundance.

For example,6 and 28 are Friendly Pairs.

    (Sum of divisors of given number1)/given number1 = (Sum of divisors of given number2)/given number2  
- sum of divisors for 6 is 1,2,3,6=(1+2+3+6)=12
- sum of divisors for 28 is 1,2,4,7,14,28=56
- (12/6)==(56/28).Its a Friendly Pair.
Input Format

Input consists of 2 integers.
Constraints

No Constraints

Output Format

If it is a Friendly Pair display "Friendly Pair" or displays "Not Friendly Pair".
Sample Input 0

15
25
Sample Output 0

The Given Number 15 and 25 are Friendly Pairs.
Sample Input 1

8
30
Sample Output 1

The Given Number 8 and 30 are Not Friendly Pairs.







# Program to check if two numbers are Friendly Pairs

# Function to calculate sum of divisors
def sum_of_divisors(n):
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            s += i
    return s

# Input
num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())

# Calculate abundances
ratio1 = sum_of_divisors(num1) / num1
ratio2 = sum_of_divisors(num2) / num2

# Check condition
if ratio1 == ratio2:
    print(f"The Given Number {num1} and {num2} are Friendly Pairs.")
else:
    print(f"The Given Number {num1} and {num2} are Not Friendly Pairs.")
