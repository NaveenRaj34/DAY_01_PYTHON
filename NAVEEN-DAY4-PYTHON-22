Seela wants to find the sum of even and odd numbers in the between range values.could you please help her to implements the program.

Input Format

Input consists of two integer.
Constraints

Given N is greater than 1 and lesser than 100.

Output Format

Print the sum of even num and odd num.

Invalid Input






# Program to calculate sum of even and odd numbers in a given range

# Taking two integers as input
start = int(input())
end = int(input())

# Check constraints
if start <= 1 or end >= 100:
    print("Invalid Input")
else:
    even_sum = 0
    odd_sum = 0
    
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += i
        else:
            odd_sum += i
    
    print(f"The Even Sum value is {even_sum:.2f}")
    print(f"The Odd Sum value is {odd_sum:.2f}")
